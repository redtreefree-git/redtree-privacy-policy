<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
RedTree ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and handled
when you use the RedTree mobile application.
</p>

<h2>Camera Access</h2>
<p>
The RedTree app may request access to your device’s camera.
</p>
<p><strong>Why we use the camera:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>To allow users to capture photos within the app</li>
  <li>To support features that require image input (such as profile photos or content uploads)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not access the camera without your explicit permission.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Images captured using the camera are used only for app functionality</li>
  <li>We do not sell, rent, or share camera data with third parties</li>
  <li>We do not use camera data for advertising or tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data
from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
RedTree may use trusted third-party services (such as cloud infrastructure)
to operate the app. These services are required to follow appropriate
data protection practices.
</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
<p>
You may deny or revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings.
Some features may not function correctly without camera access.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
RedTree is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page.
